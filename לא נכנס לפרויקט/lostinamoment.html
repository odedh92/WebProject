    <h1>Lost In A Moment</h1>
    <h4> <ins> Lost in a moment is a open air event series by the berlin music label innervisions that is travelling the world.</ins></h4>
        <br><br>
        <h3> « NEVER ASK DIRECTIONS FROM SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE WAY. YOU RISK NOT GETTING LOST. »</h3>
        <p>
            
            Searching for a summary, we realized that this one slogan captures the most of what words can express about Lost In A Moment. It is above all an experience of consciously steering toward spellbound.
            Lost In A Moment commenced at El Monasterio in Barcelona June 2012. Breaking grounds in terms of site, natural surrounding, architecture, history and atmosphere – it is the city of spellbound after all – Barcelona became the harbinger for the concept of Lost In A Moment. Since then Lost In A Moment continued to take place under the sky with never more than a feeling of about a thousand people celebrating, never full, always airy, operating with unexpected light and unreleased music to challenge and shift the mindsets connected to electronic music events. Nonetheless it has evolved and we would like to share the story of this evolution with you. <br>
            <p>
                <br>

          <h3> WHAT IS IT?</h3> 
          <p>
            Often an answer is found easiest through exclusion. Lost In A Moment is neither a festival, nor a party. It is certainly not a rave. Yet it does share one single integral element with all of these: music. The way in which music is staged at Lost In A Moment constitutes all of the difference though. True to Kerri Chandler’s house music formula of “a basement, a red light, and a feeling” it is an blend of simple ingredients: An outdoor location, a surround system, where together we dance alone. Habitually, an outdoor location has one or many artist stages opposed to an audience. One could say: A vertical top-down structure. We sabotage that. Staging happens beyond, below and on the stage at Lost In A Moment. The gaze is off the phone and off the DJ, loosing itself in the mass. For us a surround system not just addresses the sound, but the way in which people – audience and artists – approach each other. They embrace in their inwardness. <br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h3> WHERE IS IT?</h3>
            <p>
            Lost In A Moment is a journey to an outdoor location that has not been mapped by the electronic music community yet. Be it a mountain above or an island on waters close to the city, a castle just at the outskirts or a natural reserve embracing the urban periphery, Lost In A Moment always thrives for a strong sensation of space instead of just event structure. A little bit as if Walter Benjamin’s flaneur would go to the woods, listening to Âme’s Mifune on the way. With a physical remoteness from regular party life it is all about being where the sun shines. One drifts through different layers of being present. And it is this journey into presence that extends a moment until it is perfect. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>WHEN IS IT?</h3>
            <p>
            Lost In A Moment breaks the rule of the night. Its time is Sunday afternoon. Until the sunset it uses natural light. Afterwards, a sense of transillumination – light modeling space – takes over, expanding the last bit of the day, the last bit of the weekend, and the last bit of the people. Bowing to the legacy and experience of David Mancuso’s The Loft, Lost in A Moment dreams of being disco without being afterhour. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3> HOW IS IT DONE?</h3>
            <p>
            Due to the conscious choice of outdoor locations, which are mostly off the electronic music event chart, Lost In A Moment is a high-risk venture. Such a choice calls for a lot of energy to surpass regulations and limitations. We collaborate with some of the most talented and well-connected event organizers and promoters throughout the world. But even these professionals sometimes have reservations, since we never break rules, but we bend them to a point where fissures are probable.
            Lost In A Moment is ephemeral. Thus, a location we left, we will never return to. When a moment passed, it’s unrepeatable. No image, no video, no selfie, no return will ever bring it back. Like breaking a spell by snipping the fingers. Gone forever. That makes Lost In A Moment the most remorseless and simultaneously rewarding partaking in presence. For the audience, the artists and producers alike.
